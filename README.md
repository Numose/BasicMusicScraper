# AudioFile: A Basic Node.js Audio File Scraper #

[screenshot of AudioFile in action](http://i.imgur.com/niKNFAf.png)

## Summary ##
  I put together a really basic Node.js audio file scraper for a two-day hackathon. This tool works for sites with one or more embedded audio tags. Install the server locally, run it via terminal, navigate to localhost:8080 and profit!

  In case it needs to be said, please scrape responsibly.  :)

## Problem ##
  Found a bunch of sites with many embedded audio tags and I didn't want to right-click-save my life away.
